# GST_042016
Documentation for 2016 update

General Notes

	A. When renaming shapefiles, must manually change file path in CurrentMap .gprj file
		- Add shapefile to CurrentMap folder, then add through GST Layer Control, then in .gprj (path)
		- GST will rename all letters to lowercase by default

	B. In GST, Settings > Settings > Map > Save Map extent on exit

	C. We like the 1:5,000 default map scale, allows for one zoom to display addresses & hydrants

	D. Used Beyond Compare to copy GST folder to other MDC to preserve xml styling

	E. Did not update to 2014 Aerial 

Goals

	A. Clearly identify shapefile version by changing naming conventions.  Breaking the year into four quarters (q1,q2,q3,q4)

	B. Maintain xml styles we already like

	C. Turn off SRA outside of SLU
